# Booking Service Test Coverage Demo

A TypeScript implementation of a booking service system that handles hotel room bookings. This repository is designed for demonstrating test coverage improvements with Cognition AI's Devin.

## Features

- Booking management (create, confirm, cancel, complete)
- Payment processing
- Inventory/availability management
- Notification service

## Project Structure

- `src/models/`: Data models
- `src/services/`: Service implementations
- `src/tests/`: Unit tests (intentionally incomplete for demo purposes)

## Current Test Coverage Issues

This repository intentionally has low test coverage and some problematic test patterns for demonstration purposes:

1. Missing tests for PaymentService, InventoryService, and NotificationService
2. Partial coverage of BookingService methods
3. Poor test design patterns in existing tests

## Technologies

- TypeScript
- Jest for testing
"Add project documentation"
