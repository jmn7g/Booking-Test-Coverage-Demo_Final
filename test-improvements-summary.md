| InventoryService | 0% line, 0% branch | 82.35% line, 35.71% branch | +82.35% line, +35.71% branch |
| NotificationService | 0% line, 0% branch | 100% line, 100% branch | +100% line, +100% branch |
| **Overall** | ~16% line, ~8% branch | 90.22% line, 55.88% branch | +74.22% line, +47.88% branch |

## BookingService Test Improvements

| Test Area | Before | After | Improvements |
|-----------|--------|-------|--------------|
| Method Coverage | Only `createBooking` tested | All methods tested | Added tests for `confirmBooking`, `cancelBooking`, `completeBooking`, `getBooking`, `getBookingsByUser`, `getBookingsByItem`, `getActiveBookingsByItem` |
| Error Handling | Limited error testing | Comprehensive error testing | Added tests for all error conditions including invalid dates, unavailable items, incorrect booking status transitions |
| Service Interactions | No verification | Complete verification | Added spies to verify interactions with PaymentService, InventoryService, and NotificationService |
| Edge Cases | Not tested | Well covered | Added tests for edge cases like date validation, booking status transitions, and item availability |
| Test Organization | Poor structure | Well-structured | Organized tests with proper describe/test blocks for better readability and maintenance |

## Remaining Coverage Gaps

| Service | Uncovered Lines | Uncovered Branches |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| BookingService | Lines 160, 194-196 | Some branches in error handling |
| InventoryService | Lines 18, 23, 29, 38, 59, 74 | Complex date overlap logic |
| PaymentService | Lines 7, 11, 28 | All branches in payment validation |

## Key Testing Techniques Implemented

1. **Service Method Spies**: Used Jest spies to verify interactions between services
2. **Date Mocking**: Implemented Date.now() mocking for time-dependent tests
3. **State Transition Testing**: Verified correct booking status transitions
4. **Error Condition Coverage**: Added comprehensive tests for all error conditions
5. **Test Isolation**: Ensured tests don't interfere with each other by resetting state

## Recommendations for Further Improvements

1. Increase branch coverage in PaymentService by testing more payment validation scenarios
2. Add more tests for InventoryService date overlap logic
3. Implement integration tests to verify end-to-end booking workflows
4. Add performance tests for methods that might be used in high-volume scenarios
5. Consider adding property-based testing for complex date logic in InventoryService
